Hello! 
I have been actively supporting IDEP in all phases of product testing. 
I participated in the testnet and had the role of "Sanford". 
During the testnet, I kept my node running at over 95% uptime and I would love to participate in the Mainnet phase. 
I understand the importance of decentralization and the importance of node uptime, so I will be doing my job as a Mainnet validator as responsibly as possible! 
I also have experience participating and testing in the following projects: Massa, KYVE, Minima, Subspace, Aptos, Archway.
